        Hi, I’m Kyle. Thanks for stopping by :)

      <h2>Traveling</h2>
      <p>
        I was lucky enough to be raised my mother and father, both of whom have a shared appreciation for traveling. I remember my first time leaving the country as in 2013. Even as a 10 year old I knew that would set a course for the rest of my life. Since then I have had the opportunity to backpack through 9 more countries.

      <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <p>
        Currently I am in my last year of studies at the University of Connecticut "(Go Huskies!)". I am an Accounting major pursuing an internship at Deloitte, you can find my resume <a href="images/ResumeAUG.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. As you can see from the above photo, I like making food as much as I like growing it. I currently have a vegetable garden that has been giving me wonderful meals, food is at the center of my life and my family. I consider myelf a good chef, mostly because I enjoy making food for others.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve had a handful of jobs. From delivering appliances, working as a stonemason, and being a waiter at a restaurant, I feel as though I've been imbued with a very wide skillset. During the summer of 2024 I had the opportunity to WWOOF in Dogliani Italy, a small agricultural town ontop of the French Riviera. During my stay with my host family, Freddy and Ursula, I learned lots about permaculture, Italian culture, and resourcesfulness. One of my projects was building a stone retaining wall and repairing hundred year old masonry work- I find it cool to think about how there is still a piece of me left in the form of that wall out in the Italian mountains.
        These experiences shaped how I approach problem-solving and creativity.

        Like every experienced traveler knows, you never go just for the views. The friends I have made and the people I encountered while backpacking give the trip all the meaning in the world. I truly appreciate the chance to meet new people, and the opportunity to form new memories and strong friendships.

      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <p>
        As I have an academic vacation from school during the winter, I planned and decided to buy plane tickets to Costa Rica. My stay is from Dec 16 until Jan 14; during this time I am looking to have a meaningful work exchange experience. During this trip I am looking to improve my Spanish speaking competency through immersion, embrace the local Tico culture, and create lifelong memories and friendships.
