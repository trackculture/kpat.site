      <h2>My Upbringing</h2>
      <p>
        I was lucky enough to be raised my mother and father, both of whom have a shared appreciation for traveling. I remember my first time leaving the country as in 2013. Even as a 10 year old I knew that would set a course for the rest of my life. Since then I have had the opportunity to backpack through 9 more countries.

      <h2>WWOOF</h2>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to WWOOF (agricultural work exchange) in Dogliani, Italy. I stayed outside of a small agricultural town in a villa perched above the French Riviera. I had the opportunity to work for a wonderful Swiss couple, Freddy and Ursula. They quickly immersed me into their way of life and I learned about permaculture, alpine culture, and the value of natural living. My days were filled with gardening, milking goats, and harvesting produce. One of my projects was building a stone retaining wall and repairing centuries-old masonry. It’s meaningful to know that a piece of my effort still stands in those Italian mountains.  I am forever grateful for the wonderful conversations I got to share over the dinner table with Freddy  and Ursula and will forever hold that summer dear in my heart.

      <h2>"Self-Agency"</h2>
      <p>
        Experiences like these have shaped how I approach problem-solving and creativity. As a solo traveler, you sometimes have to snap back to reality. You might be dropped in the middle of a foreign country, not know anyone, and have no idea where the train is taking you. Yet, by some unplanned intuition I like to call "traveler’s legs," you always figure it out.
I remember waking up early one morning in Lisbon with a big day of traveling planned. As always, I had meticulously planned our route the night before, documenting every leg of the journey in my notes app. It wasn't until I was looking at my notes on the metro that I realized we were on the right line but heading in the exact wrong direction from the transport station we needed to be at in 30 minutes.
The traveler's legs took over instantly, and I whisked my friend out of the station the moment the doors opened—a moment when being a 400m athlete really helped. I immediately signaled to a taxi and communicated our situation in my rudimentary Spanish and Portuguese. Luckily, an enthusiastic taxi driver named Jose came right to our aid. I quickly told him where we needed to go and how much time we had, and Jose got to work. He masterfully zipped through roundabouts, utilized unknown side roads, and predicted traffic patterns. When he dropped us off, I was left with an enduring feeling of self-agency. At that moment, I understood that you don't just wait for opportunities to appear—you create them. It was a powerful lesson in making my own luck.

      <h2>My Friends</h2>
      <p>
       Travel, for me, has never been just about the views. It is about the people I meet along the way. The friendships I’ve formed and the stories I’ve shared with others on the road give every journey its deepest meaning. These connections are the reason I continue to travel, and they inspire me to keep seeking out new places and new people. I am a true extrovert and believe my relationships give meaning and a framework to life, helping me understand myself and, more importantly, the world we live in. I approach every new person as a friend I haven't met yet.

      <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I am excited for the opportunities to continue combining learning, adventure, and personal growth. During my upcoming academic break, I have planned a month-long trip to Costa Rica. From December 16th until January 14th, I will be in Costa Rica. I am currently looking for a meaningful work exchange that will give me the opportunity to immerse myself in the local Tico culture and meet brilliantly unique people. My goals for this journey are to improve my Spanish- I grew up playing Dota 2 with Cuban kids, my Spanish isn’t that bad! I also wish to embrace the rhythm of daily life, and create lasting friendships and memories.

      <h2>The Past</h2>
      <p>
        I previously was a Division 1 track athlete at URI for two years. For a long time track and field was my outlet, I was able to push myself as hard as humanly possible, and as a result I saw the accolades come flowing in. I managed to achieve All-State, All-New England, and even All-American status. I remember these times fondly and most of my lifelong friends I have today were introduced to me on the running oval. Unfortunately I received a few nagging injuries that prevent me from returning to running my best times, but this has only instilled me with a holistic and longevity centered approach to my physical training nowadays.

      <h2>Silver Linings</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, I am in my last year of studies at the University of Connecticut. I am an Accounting major pursuing an internship at Deloitte. I consider myself very academically motivated and receive good grades—you can find my resume here! The UConn Accounting Department has been transformatory for me. I have had the opportunity to take part in PHD-level academic research, been exposed to prestigious internships, and met many like minded goal-oriented people. Beyond academics, one of my passions is food. I love making it as much as I love growing it. I’m currently nurturing a vegetable garden that has given me wonderful meals. I consider myself a good chef—not only because I enjoy the process, but because I take joy in preparing meals for others. Food, for me, has always been at the center of my family and life.
My journey so far has been a blend of study, work, and travel, each experience teaching me something new about resilience, curiosity, and connection. I believe that success isn’t just about personal achievement, but about what we share with others along the way.
